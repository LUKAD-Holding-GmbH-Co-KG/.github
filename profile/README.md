# 👋 Hi!

LUKAD is an owner-managed company based in Sauerland. It combines solid down-to-earthness with global thinking and international success. The origins of LUKAD Holding go back to the founding of a scrap metal business by Arnold Menshen in the 1950s and the purchase of Walter Stauffenberg KG in the early 1960s. At the beginning of the 1970s, Arnold Menshen founded the company Georg Menshen KG.
